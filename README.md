Understand how an optical medium (even more the non-linear ones) affects the light beam propagation are of enormous importance, also being an important source of novel applications. However, provide an analytical method cappable to comprehend this (which embbed possible non-linear effects) is quite difficult (or sometimes impossible). 

The approach on the study of general optical phenomena are broadly the using of computational estimation methods. This repository aims to provide a python module with numerical routines to solve partial diferential equations which encompass the optical media effects (even if non-linear) on light propagation.
